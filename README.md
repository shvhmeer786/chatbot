Developed an AI chatbot which was trained on a hard-coded JSON dataset, which served as a knowledge base for the bot to understand and generate appropriate responses. Achieved 99.7% neural network accuracy.
Implemented a deep learning architecture using TensorFlow, Keras, TFLearn, and NLTK to build the model, enabling it to learn patterns and relationships within the dataset
